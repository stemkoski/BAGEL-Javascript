# BAGEL-Javascript
The Basic Adaptable Game Engine Library, written in JavaScript.

Notes:
- Running locally requires a web server. This is easy with Python, but requires a bit of configuration so that *.js files are served as "application/javascript" and not "text/plain"; this is handled with the server.py file in the root directory.
